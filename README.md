Our Educational Website would provide all the education related stuff : Notes, Sample Papers,
Online Video Lectures and courses to crack competitive exams like JEE-Main, JEE-Advanced,
GATE, etc. Students can clear their doubts by sending their questions to our website. We have
added Quizzes for Students who are willing to solve problems on different topics. We have also
added Interview questions for students who are preparing for placements.

✔ We have made this webapp as a responsive website so students or users can easily access our
website from any device.

✔ Quiz Section is an interesting feature for students which provides them with lots of questions.
They can view their scores easily and solutions to every question.

✔ Projects – in this I have added a project section where students from schools and colleges can
get projects for final year and for Class 12th Board Projects.
